title: About Me
---

My name is Tim Roes and I am a computer scientist and Android & web enthusiast from Karlsruhe, Germany.

In 2013, I graduated from Karlsruhe University of Applied Science with a Masterâ€™s degree in computer science.

I am passionate about technology, programming and good games (board, card or digital).

I like optimizing and customizing systems to my needs, which is why I use awesome wm as my window
manager (with a [custom config](https://github.com/timroes/awesome-config) written completely
from scratch) or built this blog with its own
[custom software](https://github.com/timroes/www.timroes.de).

After university I worked in the application development department of [inovex](http://www.inovex.de/?utm_source=Tim%20Roes&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Tim%20Roes_About%20Me)
in Karlsruhe.

Since July 2017 I am working at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) as part of the
Kibana team as a JavaScript Engineer.

You can contact me via [mail](mailto:mail@timroes.de)
or just drop me a note in one of the social networks, linked on the home page.
