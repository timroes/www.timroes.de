[[hintbox]] This tutorial was crossposted on the [official Elastic blog](https://elastic.co/blog/timelion-tutorial-from-zero-to-hero).

Timelion is an visualization tool for time series in Kibana. Time series visualizations
are visualizations, that analyze data in time order. Timelion can be used to draw
two dimensional graphs, with the time drawn on the x-axis.

What's the advantage over just using plain bar or line visualizations? Timelion
takes a different approach. Instead of using a visual editor to create charts,
you define a graph by chaining functions together, using a timelion specific
syntax. This sytnax enables some features, that classical point series charts
don't offer - like drawing data from different indices or data sources into
one graph.

This tutorial will first give a short introduction to the timelion UI in Kibana
and will afterwards explain the timelion syntax and show several use cases, that
you couldn't or still cannot do with classical Kibana visualizations.

The user interface
------------------

You can access timelion from the main navigation on the left of the page.

![An overview of the timelion app](/timelion/ui.png)

You can have multiple graphs on a timelion sheet. To add a new graph to the sheet
use the *Add* link in the top menu bar. *New* will create a completely new sheet.

The input box on top of the window shows the expression for the currently selected
graph. Click on a graph to select it for editing. All expressions you will see throughout
this tutorial will be inserted into that textbox.

Using the *Save* button in the menu, you can either store the whole timelion sheet
with all its graphs or store the currently focused graph as a visualization, that
you can place on any dashboard.

The date range of the currently shown data can be influenced by the well-known
date picker on the top right of the page. To set the scale of the x-axis, the
selectbox beside the expression input is used. By default it's set to "auto" which
will automatically determine what a good scale would be depending on the selected
time range. If you want to force e.g. one data point per day, you can set this
to *1d*.

Timelion expressions
--------------------

The simplest expression - that will also automatically be used for new graphs is
the following:

```timelion
.es(*)
```

Timelion functions always start with a dot, followed by the function name, followed
by parantheses containing all the parameters to the function (in this case just the
asterisk).

The `.es` (or `.elasticsearch` if you are a fan of typing long words) function
gathers data from Elasticsearch and draws it over time.

If you don't specify an index in the expression (we will see in a moment how you're
able to do this) all indexes of your Elasticsearch will be queried for data.
You can change this default in the [Advanced Settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/advanced-options.html)
of Kibana by modifying the `timelion:es.default_index` setting.

By default the `.es` function will just count the number of documents, resulting
in a graph showing the amount of documents over time.

[[hintbox]] If you are entering that simple expression and only get a flat line,
even though you selected a date range, which contains data: most likely
your data doesn't use `@timestamp` as the name for the main time field.
You can either change the default name via the `timelion:es.timefield` setting in
Advanced Settings, or use the `timefield` parameter in the
`.es` function to set it for an individual series. You will see how to set parameters
in the next section.

### Function parameters

Functions can have multiple parameters, and so does the `.es` function.
Each parameter has a name, that you can use inside the parantheses to set its value.

The parameters also have an order, which is shown by the autocompletion or the
documentation (using the *Docs* button in the top menu).

If you don't specify the parameter name, timelion assigns the values to the parameters
in the order, they are listed in the documentation.

The fist parameter of the `.es` function is the parameter `q` (for query), which
is a [Query String](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax)
used to filter the data for this series. You can also explicitly reference this parameter
by its name, and I would always recommend doing so as soon as you are passing more
than one parameter to the function. The following two expressions are thus equivalent:

```timelion
.es(*)
.es(q=*)
```

Multiple parameters are separated by comma. The `.es` function has another parameter
called `index`, that can be used to specify an index pattern for this series, so the
query won't be executed again all indexes (or whatever you changed the above mentioned
setting to).

```timelion
.es(q=*, index=logstash-*)
```

If the value of your parameter contains spaces or commas you have to put the value in single or double
quotes. You can omit these quotes otherwise.

```timelion
.es(q='some query', index=logstash-*)
```

### Chaining functions

A lot of the timelion functions are used to modify a series of data.
You apply these by chaining the functions in the expression. The `.label` function
is such a function. You can use it to change the label of a series:

```timelion
.es(q=country:de).label(Germany)
```

You can also chain multiple expressions, as we will see later in this tutorial.

### Multiple series

One of the advantages of using timelion is the ability to add multiple time series
to one chart. Multiple series must simply be separated by a comma in the expression:

```timelion
.es(q=de), .es(q=us)
```

You can also chain functions on each series now, e.g. for specifying labels:

```timelion
.es(q=de).label(Germany), .es(q=us).label('United States')
```

![A graph showing two series labeled Germany and United States](/timelion/multiple-series.png)

Now we covered the basics on how to work with timelion, so we can jump to a more
in depth explanation of several functions and what you can do with them.

Timelion functions
------------------

To demonstrate the functions we will use some sample data, which contains access
logs from a web server. The sample data was created using [`makelogs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/makelogs)
which you can use to create your own sample data.

### Data source functions

Data source functions can be used to load data into the graph. We've already seen
the `.es` data function, that loads data from Elasticsearch. Timelion offers
some more sources to load data from, which we will explain in this section.

#### Elasticsearch

Before we have a look at the other data source functions, we should first look
at the `.es` function again. It provides some more functionality, that we haven't
seen yet.

Since it is a common use case to split lines by the value of a specific field
(what you can do with a terms aggregation in a regular visualization), the `.es`
function has a parameter named `split` for that.

The value of the `split` parameter must be a fieldname, followed by a colon, followed
by a numeric value, on how many of the top values should get a line. The following
expression, shows the traffic of the top 4 countries (the country code is stored
in the `geo.dest` field) in our sample data:

```timelion
.es(split=country:4)
```

![A graph with 4 lines, one for each of the top 4 countries](/timelion/es-split.png)

The `metric` parameter is used to control the calculation of the y-value. By default
the `.es` function will put the count of documents on the y-axis. You can use
the `metric` parameter to specify another metrics aggregation, that should be used
to calculate the value at a specific time. The value must be the name of a single value
metrics aggregation, followed by a colon, followed by the field name to calculate
that aggregation on.

Valid names for the aggregation are e.g. `avg` to calculate the average value of a field,
`sum` for the sum, `cardinality` to get the amount of unique values in a field, `min`
and `max` to retrieve the minimum or maximum value of a field.

If we want to modify the above expression to display the top 4 countries by how
many bytes has been transferes in that country (to see what countries are responsible
for my bandwidth), you can use the `metric` parameter as follows:

```timelion
.es(split=country:4, metric=sum:bytes)
```

![The above graph but now showing the sum of bytes on the y-axis](/timelion/es-metric.png)

You can also use multiple `split` parameters to create subbuckets (as in visualizations)
and multiple `metric` parameters to draw multiple values per time point.

#### static/value

`.static` (or the alias `.value`) will just draw a plain horizontal line at the given
value. This can be useful to draw a visual threshold to a graph. You can also use the
parameter `label` to directly label the series:

```timelion
.es(), .static(25, label='good visitor level')
```

![A graph with a vertical line at value 25](/timelion/static.png)

#### World Bank

Timelion offers functions to load data directly from [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/),
which provides a lot of statistical data from around the world, e.g. population, GDP, and many more.

To pull in data from World Bank into your graph, you can use the `.wbi` (or long `.worldbank_indicators`)
function. It accepts two parameters: `country` and `indicator`.

`country` can be the ISO code of a specific country or if not specified data for the
whole world will be loaded. `indicator` must be a valid World Bank indicator. You can find
a list of all indicators on their [data portal](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator).
If you click on an indicator, you can see the actual indicator code you need to specify
in the URL, e.g. it's `NY.GDP.MKTP.CD` for the GDP of a country or `SP.POP.0014.TO.ZS`
for the population ages 0 to 14 in percentage. If you don't specify an indicator
the population is loaded.

To visualize the GDP of France and Germany, you could use the following expression.
Since World Bank only has one data point per year (and often not for the current year),
make sure to select a large enough time range (e.g. the last 50 years) to get a proper chart.

```timelion
.wbi(country=de, indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), .wbi(country=fr, indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
```

![Showing two lines of the GDP of France and Germany](/timelion/wbi-gdp.png)

[[hintbox]] If you need to manipulate the URL of the World Bank request you can use the `.wb`
function instead of `.wbi`, which expects the path of the API request as the `code`
parameter.

#### More data sources

Beside the already mentioned data sources, timelion also offers a few more data sources,
that either require am account or another software running.

`.quandl` can be used to query financial data from [Quandl](https://graphiteapp.org/)
and `.graphite` can be used to query data from a running Graphite server.


#### Offsetting data source

Each of the data source functions accept a parameter called `offset`. It can be
used to offset the data by a specific time range. This can be useful to compare
data from different time ranges. The `offset` parameter accepts positive and negative
values with a unit. Valid units are `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours,
`d` for days, `w` for weeks, `M` for months and `y` for years. It will shift the input
by the specified offset before drawing it.

To draw our current page visitors (from our sample data) compared to the visits
a week before, you can use the following expression:

```timelion
.es().label(current), .es(offset=-1w).label('prev week')
```

![Two series with one offsetted by a week](/timelion/offset-series.png)

### Styling functions

A few of the functions offered by timelion are used mainly for styling purposes.

#### Line style

By default timelion will draw the data with lines. There are three functions to
modify the actual graph types: `.lines`, `.bars` and `.points`.

Each of them support a range of parameters to modify e.g. the width of lines, the point
sizes, etc. To check all the available parameters have a look at the in-app documentation.

You can see some of the parameters demonstrated in the following expression:

```timelion
.es().bars(), .static(50).points(symbol=cross, radius=2), .static(60).lines(width=5)
```

![Three lines in different styles: bars, points and a thicker line](/timelion/line-styles.png)

#### Colors

To manually specify a color for a specific series use the `.color` function.
It expects the color as a HTML color name or a hex value in the `#rrggbb` format.
The following example illustrates the usage:

```timelion
.es(q=error).color(#FF0000), .es(q=warning).color(yellow)
```

If you used the `split` parameter and as such have multiple lines, you can
specify multiple colors separated by colon:

```timelion
.es(split=country:3).color('hotpink:grainsboro:plum')
```

### Math functions

Timelion offers several mathematical calculations on time series.

You can chain the `.abs` function, if you want the y-axis to show the absolute
values. You can use the `.log` function to calculate the logarithm of all values
(and optionally specify a logarithmic base).

```timelion
.static(-5).abs(), .static(1707).log(26)
```

![Two lines one at y=5 and one at y=2.2843, which is log(1707)/log(26)](/timelion/math-abs-log.png)

The `.cusum` function can be used to calculate the cumulative sum of all values,
i.e. the value at a specific point in time is the value of all previous points
summed up. Be aware, that the cumulative sum is only calculated from the start time of the graph
and not since the dawn of time.

The `.derivative` function can be used to calculate the derivative of a time series,
i.e. the slope of the curve:

```timelion
.es(), .es().derivative().label(derivative)
```

![A graph showing a curve and the derivative of it](/timelion/derivative.png)

The `.mvavg` (long `.movingaverage`) function can be used to smooth series, by
applying a [moving average](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/search-aggregations-pipeline-movavg-aggregation.html)
to the series. This function requires its first parameter (`window`), which specifies
the size of the window as a value and a time unit (see offsetting above), that is
used to calculate the moving average.

The following expression and it result demonstrates the smoothing effect of the
moving average:

```timelion
.es().color(#DDD), .es().mvavg(5h)
```

![The regular time series output and a smooth curve in front of it](/timelion/mvavg.png)

### Trend

Another useful feature of timelion is the possibility to draw trend lines into a graph.
You can use the `.trend` chaining function on any series, to draw the trend line of
that series instead.

To draw a trend line of the world GDP (and the actual world GDP) you can use
the following expression:

```timelion
.wbi(indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).trend(), .wbi(indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).color(#AAA)
```

![Showing a linear trend line and the world GDP](/timelion/trend.png)

### Different scales

Adding multiple series into one chart will sometimes create the issue, that the values
of both series are on completely different scales.

Let's look at the following expression, which draws the GDP of germany (in US$) and the CO2
emission (in metric tons per capita) in one graph:

```timelion
.wbi(country=de, indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), .wbi(country=de, indicator=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)
```

Luckily these two series are an order of magnitude apart, which would lead in the GDP
being clearly visible in the graph and the CO2 emission just being shown as a flat
line at the bottom of the graph.

If we are not interested in the actual values, but only in the way the curve changes
over time, we can use the `.range` function to limit a series to a new range of values,
i.e. rewriting the minimum and maximum value of the series, but leave the shape intact.

```timelion
.wbi(country=de, indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD).range(0, 10), .wbi(country=de, indicator=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC).range(0, 10)
```

![Two series now being at around the same scale](/timelion/range1.png)

That way we can now see how these two series may or may not correlate. *Of course
you should never forget, that correlation does not imply causation.*

We can simplify the above query, by using timelions grouping functionality, in which
we can group multiple series with parentheses and chain a function to the whole group:

```timelion
(.wbi(country=de, indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), .wbi(country=de, indicator=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)).range(0,10)
```

Since we lose the actual values with the range query, in our use case the `.yaxis`
function might be a bit more handy. It will assign a series, to a different
y-axis. You have to specify the number of the axis it should be using (with 1 being
the default y-axis). It optionally can make use of the `min`, `max`, `label`, `color`
and `position` parameters, to modify that y-axis.

To achieve now the similar effect as with the `.range` query, but without losing
the actual values, you can use the following expression, to move the two series
to different y-axes.

```timelion
.wbi(country=de, indicator=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), .wbi(country=de, indicator=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC).yaxis(2)
```

![The same two series as above, but with two y-axes](/timelion/y-axis.png)

There is one other scaling issue, that you can hardly solve with classical
Kibana virtualizations. Imagine you are drawing the sum of bytes of you server
log data. If you watch data from a whole week, each data point on the x-axis
will now represent one hour of data, hence have the sum of all bytes transfered
within an hour as a value. When selecting a different time range, e.g. four hours,
each data point will now only represent a minute, thus having a way lower y-axis
value. The following graphs show this situation, with the graph on the left
being a time range of a week and the one on the right a time range of four hours.
As you can see the y-axis values in the left graph are way higher.

![Two graphs with way higher y-axis values in the left graph](/timelion/sum-bytes-scales.png)

Sometimes that behavior is not what you want, because you might want to compare
absolute values with each other no matter what time range you are viewing, or
you want these values to be meaningful to you, e.g. because you want to see
all values in *bytes per second*, because you might be used to calculate bandwidth
in that unit.

The `scaled_interval` function does exactly solve that issue. It takes one parameter
(named `interval`), which accepts a time unit (as seen above). Timelion will calculate
all values, to be *per this interval* no matter what time range you are looking.
To see the *bytes per second*, specify a value of `1s`, to see the *bytes per minute*
a value of `1m`:

```timelion
.es(metric=sum:bytes).scaled_interval(1s)
```

This won't change the shape of the graph at all, it will just scale the actual values
printed on the y-axis and shown to you when hovering the graph.

### Calculate with series

Another of the great advantages in timelion is the ability to calculate with series.
You can sum, subtract, multiply or devide series by numbers or even by other
series.

A use case of this is setting information into relation to other informations.
If we use our sample webserver data to analyze the visitors from Germany in contrast
to the United States, we can use the following expression with the shown result:

```timelion
.es(de), .es(us)
```

![Showing server logs with high values for the US and lower values for Germany](/timelion/us-de-visitors.png)

As we can see we have quite some more visitors from the US than from Germany,
but of course the US has a significantly higher population than Germany.
We can use timelion to divide each series by the actual population of that country,
that we pull from World Bank as follows:

```timelion
.es(de).divide(.wbi(country=de)), .es(us).divide(.wbi(country=us))
```

![Showing the Germany curve now mostly higher than the US curve](/timelion/us-de-visitors-divided.png)

We can now see, that we reach in Germany a higher percentage of the population than
in the US.

You can use all basic operations via the `.add` (or `.plus`), `.subtract`, `.multiply`
and `.divide` function. Each accepts either a static value or another series (as in
the example above).

#### Conditional selection

Timelion offers a `.min` and `.max` function. These will take a list of multiple
series or numeric values, and will always return the minimum of all series/numeric values
or maximum (depending on which function you used).

You could that way for example cap a graph at a specific value:

```timelion
.min(.es(), 25)
```

![A series of data capped at 25](/timelion/min.png)

Another use case of using `.min` and `.max` is coloring graphs conditionally.
You could e.g. highlight a series, if it crosses a specific threshold (in this
case 25) as follows:

```timelion
.es().bars(stack=false).color(#F44336), .min(.es(), 25).bars(stack=false).color(#8BC34A)
```

![A two colored chart with some peaks being red](/timelion/min-max-coloring.png)

This will first draw the regular `.es()` data as bars in a red color, and then draw
the same data, but capped at 25 in green color. That way the green bars will overdraw
the red color and the red bars will only show above a threshold of 25.

If you want a more complex solution for conditional selection, you can use the
`.if` (or long `.condition`) function to provide a condition and values for the
case the condition is true or false.

Rashid Khan posted a great blog post called [*I have but one .condition()*](https://www.elastic.co/blog/timeseries-if-then-else-with-timelion),
which explains these functions in detail and show beautiful use cases of their usage.


What's next?
------------

As we've seen in this tutorial timelion offers a wide range of features and possibilities.
Some of them cannot be done with classical visualizations, though the feature set
of classical visualizations is growing fast - combo charts, pipeline aggregations,
and more are just some of the nice new features. It also takes a different approach by
using an expression language instead of a classical UI editor.

If you want to continue learning about timelion, I would recommend the
[Getting Started Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.5/timelion-getting-started.html)
in the documentation.

If you are trying to do more complex math, [*Mathlion*](https://github.com/fermiumlabs/mathlion)
a free plugin for advanced math calculations in timelion, is worth a look. Davide
Bortolami wrote a great blog post about
[Computation near the visualization layer](https://www.elastic.co/blog/computation-near-the-visualization-layer)
explaining the background and use cases of *Mathlion*.

Since Kibana 5.4 an experimental new [*Time Series Visual Builder*](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.5/time-series-visual-builder.html)
has been introduced. It offers a lot of the functionality timelion does (and even some more),
but using a graphical editor instead of an expression language. As of Kibana 5.5
timelion and the graphical time series builder are not equivalent feature wise.
So you might want to give both a try and see which fit your needs better.
